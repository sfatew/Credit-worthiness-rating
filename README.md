# Credit worthiness rating
(Course project)

### we provide a 'requirment.txt' file for library downloading. Simplely use 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to download all the library needed for the program to run smoothly.

#### In this project we will use 6 machine learning model to selve the Credit rating problem. The program is divided in to folders. Data folder contain the data we use, both before and after preprocessing. Folders which name is the algorithm name each contain neccesary file, evaluation and final model of that algorithm. The evaluation is in the '.iynb' file of each folder. We also design a webside which display our model evaluation metrics and a form for the user to fill in. We then take the data from this form and use our model to predict. (unfortunately we haven't been able to put random forest on to our webside)

#### To run and access the webside https://nhatquang510.github.io/dashboard
Main Dashboard is displaying some statistic about our data and algorithms performances.
