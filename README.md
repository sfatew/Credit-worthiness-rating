# Credit worthiness rating

### we provide a 'requirment.txt' file for library downloading. Simplely use 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to download all the library needed for the program to run smoothly.

#### In this project we will use 6 machine learning model to selve the Credit rating problem. The program is divided in to folders. Data folder contain the data we use, both before and after preprocessing. Folders which name is the algorithm name each contain neccesary file, evaluation and final model of that algorithm. The evaluation is in the '.iynb' file of each folder. We also design a webside which display our model evaluation metrics and a form for the user to fill in. We then take the data from this form and use our model to predict. 

#### To run and access the webside
